To start the game, please launch the game from MainMenu scene.

Use WASD to move, SPACE to jump. Press left mouse to shoot, right mouse to aim. 
Press F to pick up items, press E to recharge the tower, press R to reload, press G to throw grenade, press T to throw smoke grenade.

Players can pick up two weapons and switch between them using the number keys 1 and 2. Smoke grenades can blind zombies within a certain range.
Grenades can deal significant damage to zombies within a certain range without harming the player.
Oil barrel will explode after being hit by bullets multiple times, damaging both players and zombies within the area. They will then leave an oil slick that slows down any entities that come into it. Players who remain inside the slick for too long will take damage.

Players need to collide with the energy orbs to collect them, instead of using the key F. The tower can only be charged when a player has more than one energy orb and is close enough to it. Within the tower's light area, player bullets will deal double damage. The light area will shrink over time, and players need to recharge the tower to increase its size again.

The winning condition is to survive ten waves of zombie attacks and ensure that the tower's light does not go out.
